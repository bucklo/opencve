# Webhook Implementation - Quick Win Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Fixed Critical Bug in WebhookNotifier
**File**: `scheduler/dags/includes/notifiers.py`
- Fixed incorrect `super().__init__()` call in both `WebhookNotifier` and `EmailNotifier` classes
- Changed from `super().__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)` to `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)`
- This bug would have prevented webhook notifications from initializing properly

### 2. ✅ Enhanced UI for Webhook Configuration
**Files Modified**:
- `web/projects/templates/projects/notifications/_webhook.html`
- `web/projects/templates/projects/notifications/save.html`

**Improvements**:
- Added helpful descriptions for URL and headers fields
- Added inline example for headers JSON format
- Added modal with complete payload example
- Added "Test Webhook" button for existing webhook notifications
- Added visual feedback for test results (success/failure with status codes)

### 3. ✅ Implemented Test Webhook Feature
**Files Modified**:
- `web/projects/views.py` - Added `NotificationTestView` class
- `web/projects/urls.py` - Added URL route for webhook testing
- `web/requirements.txt` - Added `requests==2.32.3` dependency

**Functionality**:
- New `/test` endpoint for webhook notifications
- Sends realistic test payload with sample CVE data
- Returns JSON response with success/failure status and HTTP status code
- Handles connection errors, timeouts, and HTTP errors gracefully
- Only works for webhook type notifications (rejects email)
- Requires organization owner permissions
- 10-second timeout for webhook requests

### 4. ✅ Created Comprehensive Tests
**File**: `web/tests/projects/test_webhook_notifications.py`

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Webhook form validation
- ✅ Webhook creation with all configuration options
- ✅ Webhook updates
- ✅ Successful webhook test with mocked HTTP response
- ✅ Failed webhook test (HTTP 500)
- ✅ Rejection of testing non-webhook notifications
- ✅ Headers validation (must be string key-value pairs)
- ✅ CVSS score filtering
- ✅ Event type filtering

**Total**: 8 test cases covering critical functionality

### 5. ✅ Complete Documentation
**File**: `WEBHOOKS.md`

**Documentation Includes**:
- Overview and use cases
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Complete payload schema with field descriptions
- Event type reference
- Real-world example payloads (single CVE, multiple CVEs)
- Implementation examples in 3 languages:
  - Python (Flask)
  - Node.js (Express)
  - Go
- Testing instructions
- Security best practices
- Reliability guidelines
- Performance recommendations
- Troubleshooting guide
- Common integration patterns (Slack, database storage)

## How to Use Webhooks

### For Users:

1. **Create a Webhook Notification**:
   ```
   Project → Notifications → Add Notification → Select "Webhook"
   ```

2. **Configure**:
   - URL: `https://your-app.com/webhook`
   - Headers (optional): `{"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"}`
   - Set CVSS threshold and event types

3. **Test**:
   - Click "Test Webhook" button
   - Verify your endpoint receives the test payload
   - Check status code and response

4. **View Payload Example**:
   - Click "View payload example" link
   - See complete JSON structure in modal

### For Developers:

See `WEBHOOKS.md` for:
- Complete payload schema
- Implementation examples
- Best practices
- Integration patterns

## Testing

Run the webhook tests:
```bash
cd web
pytest tests/projects/test_webhook_notifications.py -v
```

Test in browser:
1. Start the Django dev server
2. Create a webhook notification
3. Use tools like webhook.site or RequestBin to receive test webhooks
4. Click "Test Webhook" to verify connectivity

## Files Changed

### Modified Files:
1. `scheduler/dags/includes/notifiers.py` - Bug fix
2. `web/projects/views.py` - Added NotificationTestView
3. `web/projects/urls.py` - Added test route
4. `web/projects/templates/projects/notifications/_webhook.html` - Enhanced UI
5. `web/projects/templates/projects/notifications/save.html` - Added modal and JS
6. `web/requirements.txt` - Added requests library

### New Files:
1. `web/tests/projects/test_webhook_notifications.py` - Test suite
2. `WEBHOOKS.md` - Complete documentation
3. `WEBHOOK_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Existing Infrastructure Verified

The webhook infrastructure was already partially implemented:
- ✅ `WebhookNotifier` class in scheduler (now fixed)
- ✅ `WebhookForm` in web application
- ✅ Webhook type support in views
- ✅ Template structure for webhook config
- ✅ Database schema supports webhook configuration
- ✅ Airflow DAG processes webhooks alongside emails

## What's Working Now

1. **Create webhook notifications** via UI with URL and headers
2. **Configure filters** by CVSS score and event types
3. **Test webhooks** with one-click button
4. **View payload examples** directly in the UI
5. **Receive real notifications** when CVEs match project subscriptions
6. **Custom headers** for authentication (API keys, Bearer tokens, etc.)

## Technical Details

### Webhook Payload Structure:
The webhook sends a POST request with JSON containing:
- Organization, project, and notification metadata
- Subscription information (raw and human-readable)
- Time period for changes
- Array of CVE changes with:
  - CVE ID, description, CVSS score
  - Matched subscriptions
  - Event types and data

### Security:
- Custom headers for authentication
- HTTPS recommended (enforced in production)
- 10-second timeout prevents hanging
- Error handling for all network issues
- Only organization owners can create/test webhooks

### Performance:
- Async notification delivery via Airflow
- Chunked processing for large notification batches
- Redis caching for intermediate data
- Configurable concurrency limits

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

While the quick win is complete, consider these future improvements:

1. **Retry Mechanism**: Auto-retry failed webhook deliveries with exponential backoff
2. **Delivery Logs**: Track webhook delivery success/failure history
3. **HMAC Signatures**: Add payload signing for enhanced security
4. **Webhook Templates**: Pre-configured templates for Slack, Discord, Teams
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent webhook endpoint overload
6. **Batch Configuration**: Send multiple changes in batches vs real-time
7. **Webhook Activity Dashboard**: View delivery stats and recent failures

## Migration Notes

**No database migrations required** - the existing schema already supports webhook notifications.

The `configuration` JSON field in `opencve_notifications` table stores:
```json
{
  "types": ["created", "metrics", ...],
  "metrics": {"cvss31": "7.0"},
  "extras": {
    "url": "https://...",
    "headers": {"Authorization": "..."}
  }
}
```

## Support

For issues:
1. Check `WEBHOOKS.md` for troubleshooting
2. Use "Test Webhook" button to verify connectivity
3. Review notification configuration and filters
4. Check webhook endpoint logs for incoming requests

## Conclusion

The webhook notification feature is now **fully functional** with:
- ✅ Bug fixes for core functionality
- ✅ User-friendly UI with testing capability
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Solid test coverage
- ✅ Production-ready error handling

Estimated implementation time: **2-3 hours** ✨
